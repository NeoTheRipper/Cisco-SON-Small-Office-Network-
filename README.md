"Cisco-SON-Small-Office-Network-" 

In this project, a Small Office Network was built using "Cisco Packet Tracer". Basic router configurations were also made, routing (EIGRP), dhcp, static nat and other basic router configurations were made. I hope it will be useful for beginners. by opening the console screen: 
"enable" 
to switch to privileged mode. To view the configurations: 
"show running-config" 
you can write it. I hope it will be useful, don't forget to give a star if you did :)
